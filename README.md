# ✍️ToDo Application

This project created using the <b>MERN </b>(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) stack is a web-based application that helps users manage their daily tasks and stay organized. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.

📌The app's frontend is built using <b>React.js</b>, which provides a modern and dynamic user interface. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks that are no longer relevant.

📌The app's backend is built using<b> Node.js</b> and <b>Express.js</b>, providing a RESTful API for data storage and retrieval. <b>MongoDB </b>is used as the database for storing task-related data, such as task descriptions, due dates, and completion status.
